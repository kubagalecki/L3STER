# Examples

This directory houses self-contained examples of L3STER usage.
You may build and run them directly from the directories in which they reside.

The examples consume L3STER as a CMake project directory.
If you copy a directory containing an example to a different location, be sure to update the path referenced by `add_subdirectory` in the example's `CMakeLists.txt`

### Usage
Assuming all L3STER dependencies are visible to CMake (e.g. when a spack environment containing them is active), you can build and run the examples as follows:

```bash
# Starting in example directory
pwd # [...]/L3STER/examples/example-name

# Subdirectory for the build
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpic++ ..

# Build
cmake --build .

# Due to mixing 2 different parallel runtimes (OpenMP & TBB), setting these environment variables is crucial for good performance
export OMP_PROC_BIND=false     # Disable binding - let the system scheduler take care of the threads (also silences Kokkos warning)
export OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE # OpenMP threads should go to sleep immediately after parallel work completes. Important!
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=[NHWT]  # NHWT=number of hardware threads (this is likely the default behavior, but it's best to make sure)

# If you're just running the example on your local machine (which is entirely sufficient), simply run the produced executable
./example-name
```
